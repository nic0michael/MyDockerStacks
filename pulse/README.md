## What is Pulse

1. Pulse is described as ‚Äúa responsive monitoring platform for Proxmox VE, PBS, and Docker with real-time metrics across nodes and containers.‚Äù 
GitHub

2. It‚Äôs open-source, licensed under the MIT License.

Here‚Äôs a summary of the GitHub repo Pulse (by Robert Courtman ‚Äî github user `rcourtman`):

---


### Key Features

Some highlights from the README include:

* **Auto-Discovery**: Pulse can find Proxmox nodes on your network and has a one-liner setup script. ([GitHub][1])
* **Cluster Support**: You set up one node and it monitors the entire cluster. ([GitHub][1])
* **Unified Monitoring**: Nodes, VMs/containers, storage, backups (Proxmox Backup Server integration) and optionally Docker containers via an agent. ([GitHub][1])
* **Alerting**: Supports email and webhooks (Discord, Slack, Telegram, Teams, ntfy.sh, Gotify) with adaptive thresholds and history/timeline of alerts. ([GitHub][1])
* **Privacy-focused**: No telemetry, no external API calls unless you configure webhooks. Data stays on your server. ([GitHub][1])
* **Security**: Strong security features‚Äîcredentials encrypted at rest, CSRF protection, rate limiting, account lockout, secure session cookies, bcrypt password hashing, secure storage of API tokens, security headers. ([GitHub][1])

---

### Installation & Deployment

* Installer script: `curl ‚Ä¶ | bash` ‚Äì auto-detects Proxmox and creates a container. ([GitHub][1])
* Docker: `docker run -d -p 7655:7655 -v pulse_data:/data rcourtman/pulse:latest` ([GitHub][1])
* Kubernetes / Helm: Provided via Helm chart (OCI registry) for more advanced deployment. ([GitHub][1])
* Supports environment variables for configuration (ports, auth credentials, discovery subnet, etc). ([GitHub][1])

---

### Configuration & Usage

* After installation you access the UI (default port 7655) and complete first-time setup: admin user/password, API tokens. ([GitHub][1])
* Nodes are added via UI with a 'Setup Script' generated by Pulse or via API token automation. ([GitHub][1])
* Docker agent: optional lightweight agent for container monitoring to feed data back to Pulse. ([GitHub][1])
* Configuration files: `.env` (auth credentials), `system.json` (app settings), `nodes.enc` (encrypted node credentials) etc. ([GitHub][1])
* Alert rules: custom rules via UI (thresholds, AND/OR logic, per-VM/container patterns). ([GitHub][1])
* Reverse proxy / SSO: Guides provided for using Pulse behind Nginx, Caddy, Traefik and integrating with SSO solutions. ([GitHub][1])

---

### Why it might appeal (especially for you)

Given your interest in homelab, Proxmox, monitoring, Docker, etc (as from your memory):

* Pulse is very aligned: supports Proxmox VE + Proxmox Backup Server + Docker.
* It‚Äôs self-hosted, open-source, no third-party telemetry: fits your privacy/no-ads stance.
* It supports modern deployment modes (Docker, Helm/Kubernetes) which fits your workshop/homelab style.
* The security and alerting features are solid; you could integrate into your homelab monitoring stack.
* Good for multi-node/homelab scenarios (clusters, containers, backups) which you seem to cover in your videos/workshops.

---

### Notes / Caveats

* Being one developer (per README) means support might be limited or slower for big enterprise issues. ([GitHub][1])
* The auto-discovery may scan wide subnets by default (192.168.0.0/16, etc) which you may want to configure carefully in homelab or segmented networks. ([GitHub][1])
* For VM disk metrics in Proxmox, guest agent must be installed for accurate disk usage (noted in troubleshooting). ([GitHub][1])
* When deploying in containerised / cluster mode, ensure your reverse proxy supports WebSockets for the real-time UI. ([GitHub][1])

## Installation Procedure
Run these commands in the terminal:
```sh
sudo su -

mkdir /opt/stacks/pulse -p

cd /opt/stacks/pulse 

nano compose.yaml

```
Put this is the file:
```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  pulse:
    image: rcourtman/pulse:latest
    container_name: pulse
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "${PULSE_PORT}:7655"
    environment:
      PULSE_AUTH_USER: ${PULSE_AUTH_USER}
      PULSE_AUTH_PASS: ${PULSE_AUTH_PASS}
      API_TOKEN: ${PULSE_API_TOKEN}
      DISCOVERY_SUBNET: ${PULSE_DISCOVERY_SUBNET}
    volumes:
      - ${PULSE_DATA_PATH}:/data



```
Run this command:
```sh
nano .env
```
Put this in the file:
```env
# Pulse environment file

# Web UI port (host:container)
PULSE_PORT=7655

# Admin credentials (Pulse will hash password internally)
PULSE_AUTH_USER=admin
PULSE_AUTH_PASS=Letmein1$

# Pre-generated API token (for agents/webhooks)
PULSE_API_TOKEN=1bd764fae4c664d7f6158a814f8bf718f9e32e0c88b85fadb3ae2980eeea05f8

# Limit network discovery to your subnet
PULSE_DISCOVERY_SUBNET=10.154.2.0/24

# Host path for data persistence
PULSE_DATA_PATH=/home/linuxadmin/homelabservices/pulse/data

```

## Start Pulse
Run these commands:
```sh
docker compose pull

# Start in Detached Mode
docker compose up -d
```

## Credentials

* **Username:** `admin`
* **Password:** `MySuperPassword`

Those come from these lines:

```bash
PULSE_AUTH_USER=admin
PULSE_AUTH_PASS=MySuperPassword
```

When Pulse starts for the first time, it will:

* Create that `admin` account.
* Internally hash (`bcrypt`) the password `MySuperPassword`.
* Save it in its local database so you can log in at
  üëâ **http://<your-server-ip>:7655**

‚úÖ **Tip:** After logging in, you should change the password through the Pulse UI (Settings ‚Üí Users) for better security.
